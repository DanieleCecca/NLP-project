# NLP Project

## Overview

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks focused on various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The primary areas of exploration include Named Entity Recognition (NER) using BERT, dataset creation for NER, and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Contents

- **BERT_NER.ipynb**: This notebook demonstrates the implementation of Named Entity Recognition using the BERT model. It covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The training is performed on a dataset created with an LLM. The model used is **BioBERT**, which is pre-trained on healthcare-related documents. The notebook includes:
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - Tokenization using BERT
  - Model fine-tuning
  - Evaluation using accuracy metrics

- **Creazione_Dataset_Ner.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on creating a dataset for NER tasks in **IOB format**. The dataset is intended for training BERT/BioBERT models. The steps include:
  - Extracting text from PDFs while ignoring tables
  - Using OpenAIâ€™s GPT for zero-shot entity annotation
  - Defining entity categories: **problema (problem), esame (exam), operazione (operation), farmaci (medications)**
  - Formatting data for model training

- **FinetuningLLM.ipynb**: This notebook provides a guide on **fine-tuning an LLM using distillation**. It leverages **Unsloth AI** to fine-tune a model on responses generated by **Gemini or GPT-4**, using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**. The approach includes:
  - Installing necessary libraries
  - Data formatting with chat templates
  - Training with phrase-by-phrase adaptation
  - Future consideration: full-context fine-tuning
